# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Overview: 
In this unit, coders will create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The Rock, Paper, Scissors game will take user choice, generate a computer choice, and display the winner to the screen. To create this project, coders will use jQuery to take user input and display data, arrays to store user choice, the Math Library to generate a random index, and conditionals determine the winner.

## Projects Extensions:
* Validate input so that it will return “Not valid input” if the user types in a wrong choice. 
* Will accept any form of a word regardless of capitalization (i.e. “Rock” “rock” roCk”)
* Will keep track of total wins and losses, until the page refreshes. 
* Create a game with more variety in throwing options. Example: [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)
